# Blood Compiler Bootstrap Makefile
#
# Key targets:
#   make build        - Build bootstrap compiler (cargo build --release)
#   make bootstrap    - Full bootstrap cycle (build + compile self-hosted)
#   make self-host    - Compile self-hosted compiler with itself
#   make test         - Run all tests (cargo test + ground-truth)
#   make ground-truth - Run ground-truth test suite only
#   make clean        - Clean build artifacts
#
# Configuration:
#   BLOOD_REPO  - Path to the blood language repo (default: ~/blood)
#   JOBS        - Parallel jobs for cargo (default: auto)
