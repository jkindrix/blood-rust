# Blood vs Rust: Comprehensive Comparison

**Purpose**: Detailed comparison of Blood and Rust for evaluators choosing between the languages.

Both Blood and Rust are systems programming languages focused on memory safety without garbage collection. However, they achieve this through fundamentally different approaches.

---

## Executive Summary

| Aspect | Blood | Rust |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Memory Safety** | Generational references with runtime checks | Ownership + borrowing with compile-time checks |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate (effects require new thinking) | Steep (lifetimes require deep understanding) |
| **Performance** | Excellent (small runtime overhead) | Excellent (zero-cost abstractions) |
| **Effect System** | Built-in algebraic effects | No built-in (use traits/async) |
| **Ecosystem** | Early stage | Mature, extensive |
| **Compile Times** | Fast (incremental) | Slow to moderate |

---

## 1. Memory Safety Model

### Rust: Ownership and Borrowing

Rust prevents memory errors through **compile-time ownership tracking**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // s1 is MOVED, no longer valid

    // println!("{}", s1);  // ERROR: value borrowed after move

    let s3 = String::from("world");
    let len = calculate_length(&s3);  // borrow s3
    println!("{} has length {}", s3, len);  // s3 still valid
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}  // s goes out of scope, but doesn't drop what it refers to
```

**Rust's Key Rules:**
1. Each value has exactly one owner
2. When owner goes out of scope, value is dropped
3. You can have either one mutable reference OR many immutable references
4. References must always be valid

**Advantages:**
- Zero runtime overhead
- Bugs caught at compile time
- No data races possible

**Disadvantages:**
- Steep learning curve (lifetimes are notoriously difficult)
- "Fighting the borrow checker" is common
- Some valid patterns require `unsafe` or restructuring
- Self-referential structures are difficult

### Blood: Generational References

Blood prevents memory errors through **runtime generation checks**:

```blood
fn main() {
    let s1: String = String::from("hello");
    let s2: String = s1;  // s1 is COPIED (MVS - copy by default)

    // Both s1 and s2 are valid and independent
    println_str(s1);  // OK: s1 still valid
    println_str(s2);  // OK: s2 is a copy

    // References work naturally (for efficiency, to avoid copying)
    let s3: String = String::from("world");
    let len: usize = calculate_length(&s3);
    println_str(s3);  // OK: only borrowed, not copied
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

**Blood's Key Concepts (Mutable Value Semantics):**
1. Values are **copied by default** (no implicit moves like Rust)
2. Use `&T` references when you want to avoid copying (efficiency)
3. For single-use resources, use explicit `linear T` qualifier

**Blood's Key Concepts (Memory Safety):**
1. Each heap allocation has a generation counter
2. References store a snapshot of the generation
3. Access checks compare stored vs current generation
4. Freed memory increments generation, invalidating old references

**Advantages:**
- Simpler mental model (no lifetime annotations)
- More flexible data structures (self-referential is easy)
- No "borrow checker battles"
- Errors still caught (at runtime, with helpful messages)

**Disadvantages:**
- Small runtime overhead (~1-4 cycles per checked access)
- Errors manifest at runtime, not compile time
- 128-bit pointers increase memory pressure for pointer-heavy code

### Comparison: The Same Pattern

**Rust** - A graph structure requires `Rc<RefCell<T>>` or `unsafe`:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

struct Node {
    value: i32,
    neighbors: Vec<Rc<RefCell<Node>>>,
}

fn create_cycle() {
    let node1 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Node {
        value: 1,
        neighbors: vec![],
    }));
    let node2 = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Node {
        value: 2,
        neighbors: vec![Rc::clone(&node1)],
    }));

    // Add cycle
    node1.borrow_mut().neighbors.push(Rc::clone(&node2));
    // Memory leak: Rc cycle won't be freed automatically!
    // Need Weak references to break cycle
}
```

**Blood** - Graph structures work naturally:

```blood
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    neighbors: Vec<&Node>,
}

fn create_cycle() {
    let node1 = Node { value: 1, neighbors: vec![] };
    let node2 = Node { value: 2, neighbors: vec![&node1] };

    // Add cycle naturally
    node1.neighbors.push(&node2);

    // When scope ends, all nodes freed, references invalidated
    // No memory leak, no Rc/Weak complexity
}
```

## 2. Effect System vs Traits

### Rust: Traits for Abstraction

Rust uses traits for polymorphism and effect-like patterns:

```rust
// Error handling: Result type + ? operator
fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

// Async requires different syntax
async fn fetch_url(url: &str) -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {
    let response = reqwest::get(url).await?;
    let body = response.text().await?;
    Ok(body)
}

// Logging requires dependency injection
trait Logger {
    fn log(&self, msg: &str);
}

fn process<L: Logger>(data: &str, logger: &L) {
    logger.log("Processing started");
    // ...
    logger.log("Processing complete");
}
```

**Rust Patterns:**
- `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- `async`/`await` for async operations
- Traits for dependency injection
- Each "effect" has different syntax

### Blood: Unified Effect System

Blood uses algebraic effects for all control flow effects:

```blood
// All effects declared uniformly
effect IO {
    fn read_file(path: String) -> String;
    fn println(msg: String) -> ();
}

effect Async {
    fn spawn<T>(task: fn() -> T) -> Future<T>;
    fn await<T>(f: Future<T>) -> T;
}

effect Log {
    fn log(msg: String) -> ();
}

// Function declares what effects it uses
fn process(data: String) with IO, Log {
    do Log.log("Processing started".to_string());
    let content = do IO.read_file(data);
    do Log.log("Processing complete".to_string());
}

// Handlers provide implementations
handler ConsoleIO: IO {
    fn read_file(path: String) -> String {
        resume(std::fs::read_to_string(&path).unwrap())
    }
    fn println(msg: String) -> () {
        println!("{}", msg);
        resume(())
    }
}

handler TestIO: IO {
    fn read_file(path: String) -> String {
        resume("mock content".to_string())  // For testing
    }
    fn println(msg: String) -> () {
        resume(())  // Silent in tests
    }
}
```

**Blood's Effect Advantages:**
- Uniform syntax for all effects
- Handlers are swappable (great for testing)
- No "function coloring" (async doesn't infect signatures)
- Effects compose naturally

**Trade-off:**
- New mental model to learn
- Handler overhead for some patterns (~150 cycles for continuations)

## 3. Compile Times

### Rust: Notoriously Slow

Rust's compile times are a known pain point:

```
$ time cargo build --release
   Compiling project v0.1.0
    Finished release [optimized] in 2m 34s

real    2m34.567s
```

**Why Rust is Slow:**
- Monomorphization creates code for each generic instantiation
- LLVM optimization passes are expensive
- Incremental compilation helps but has limits
- Procedural macros re-run on changes

### Blood: Fast Iteration

Blood prioritizes compile speed:

```
$ time bloodc build --release project.blood
   Compiling project v0.1.0
    Finished release [optimized] in 12s

real    0m12.345s
```

**Why Blood is Faster:**
- Simpler type system (no lifetime inference)
- MIR designed for fast compilation
- Effect type checking is local
- Content-addressed caching for unchanged code

**Comparison:**

| Project Size | Rust (clean) | Rust (incremental) | Blood (clean) | Blood (incremental) |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Small (1K LOC) | 15s | 3s | 2s | <1s |
| Medium (10K LOC) | 2m | 20s | 15s | 3s |
| Large (100K LOC) | 15m+ | 2m | 2m | 15s |

*Note: Blood numbers are projections based on design goals.*

## 4. Error Messages

### Rust: Helpful but Dense

Rust's error messages are informative but can be overwhelming:

```rust
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `vec` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
  --> src/main.rs:4:5
   |
3  |     let first = &vec[0];
   |                  --- immutable borrow occurs here
4  |     vec.push(4);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
5  |     println!("{}", first);
   |                    ----- immutable borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
```

**Rust Error Characteristics:**
- Very detailed with source spans
- Explains why the error occurred
- Often suggests fixes
- Can be overwhelming for beginners

### Blood: Runtime with Context

Blood errors occur at runtime with context:

```
Error: Use after free detected
  at src/main.blood:15:10

  let item = &container[0];
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ reference created here (generation 42)

  container.clear();  // line 14 - invalidated references

  println!("{}", item);  // line 15 - access with stale generation
                 ^^^^ attempted access with generation 42, current is 43

Backtrace:
  main() at src/main.blood:15
  process_items() at src/lib.blood:87
```

**Blood Error Characteristics:**
- Shows where reference was created
- Shows what invalidated it
- Includes generation numbers for debugging
- Runtime means some bugs reach production

## 7. Migration Guide

### From Rust to Blood

**Direct Translations:**

```rust
// Rust Result
fn parse(s: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseError> {
    s.parse().map_err(|_| ParseError::Invalid)
}
```

```blood
// Blood Effect
effect Parse {
    fn error(msg: String) -> !;
}

fn parse(s: String) -> i32 with Parse {
    match s.parse() {
        Ok(n) => n,
        Err(_) => do Parse.error("Invalid number".to_string()),
    }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Remove lifetime annotations
2. Replace `Result<T, E>` with effect declarations
3. Replace `?` with `do Effect.operation()`
4. Replace trait implementations with handlers
5. Remove `async`/`await` (use Async effect instead)

### From Blood to Rust

If you need to port Blood code to Rust:

1. Add lifetime annotations where needed
2. Replace effect declarations with traits
3. Replace handlers with trait implementations
4. Add `Result` types for fallible operations
5. Consider `async` for concurrent operations
